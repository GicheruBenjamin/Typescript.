# INTRO
Typescript is a superset of javascript.
U add types to the lady Javascript.

##  Primitives 
Primitive types:
1. number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
2. string: Represents textual data.
3. boolean: Represents true or false values.
4. null and undefined: Represents the absence of a value.
5. void: Used to indicate that a function doesn't return a value.
6. any: A dynamic type that allows any value to be assigned to it. It's generally not recommended to use any unless necessary, as it bypasses TypeScript's type checking.
7. never: Represents a value that never occurs. It's typically used to indicate that a function never returns or always throws an error.
